## Tank Tactics

### Gameplay
Game board is a grid of (X) by (Y) size  
Any size is acceptable

At the beginning of the game player's tanks are placed randomly on the board  
All Tanks start off with **3 Health** and **1 Action Token**  
Each tank starts with a cannon range of 1, meaning only tanks that are directly adjacent or diagonal to them can be targeted

### Gameplay Loop
At the begining of each day all living players are given an **Action Token**  

**Action Tokens** can be:
1. Used to move your tank in a cardinal direction
1. Used to atack an enemy player within your tank cannon's range, dealing 1 (one) damage
1. Donated to a player within your tank cannon's range, reducing your **Action Token** count by 1 and increasing the recieveing players by 1.
1. Used to upgrade you tank cannon's range by 1 tier (Highest tier of 3, meaning 3 squares away adjacent or diagonally from your tank)

Tanks do not regenerate health  
Players who's tanks have died are allowed to cast a vote to a living player once per day  
When the next day comes each living player recieves 1 (one) **Action Token** plus the total votes cast to them by any dead players  

### The Goal
Be the last tank of the battle field
